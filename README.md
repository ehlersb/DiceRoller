Dice Roller problem (#364) from /r/DailyProgrammer

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/8s0cy1/20180618_challenge_364_easy_create_a_dice_roller/

I made the dice itself object oriented. The solution was done in a main method. The command line arguments are parsed (format "NdM" as per
the problem description) then the sum followed by the rolls are printed (again, as per the bonus section of the problem).
